This app contains the full functionality of Uber without the payment processing which I never intended to implement. To start off I created a login and map activity for both customers and drivers. The main activity will start the map activity of customer or driver depending on if the user is logged or not. If the user is not logged in, the login activity is started, where the user can either login(if their information is stored in Firebase) or register which will store information in the database. The login activity that is started depends on which button the user clicks inside the MainActivity.

A user that is a customer may access the CustomerMapActivity if they are registered within the database. This also applies for a user trying to access the DriverMapActivity. Once this activity starts, the location of the customer is grabbed and stored. When the "Call Uber" button is clicked, the latitude and longitude of the customer is compared with the latitude and longitude of all logged on drivers within 10 miles. When the closest match is found, an alert is send to the closest driver that a customer is waiting to be picked up. A route is drawn for both the customer and the driver. Once the longitude and latitude of both are the same, the application is terminated.
